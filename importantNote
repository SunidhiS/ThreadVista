**Note: Running this website on a Live Server**

This website is designed to work best when served from a live server environment. A live server provides several benefits that enhance the website's functionality and performance:

1. **Dynamic Content Loading:** This website may load dynamic content asynchronously using JavaScript. A live server ensures that these dynamic elements and content updates are properly executed, allowing for a seamless user experience.

2. **Cross-Origin Requests:** Some features, such as fetching data from external sources or APIs, may require making cross-origin requests. A live server handles these requests more effectively, preventing potential security issues that can occur when opening HTML files directly in a browser.

3. **Relative Paths:** The website uses relative paths for resource references like stylesheets, scripts, and images. A live server resolves these paths correctly, ensuring that all assets are loaded as intended.

4. **Optimal Functionality:** Certain JavaScript features, especially those relying on server-side logic or APIs, may not work as expected when the website is opened directly as a file. A live server provides the necessary environment for these features to function optimally.

To run this website on a live server:

1. Open the main HTML file (usually named index.html) in your code editor.

2. Start a live server using your code editor's built-in tools or by using extensions or plugins available for popular code editors like Visual Studio Code.

3. Your default web browser will automatically open, and the website will load within the live server environment.

By running the website on a live server, you'll ensure that all features, styles, and dynamic content work as intended, providing the best possible user experience.
